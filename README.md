Sharing Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn Exercises!

I created notes with Python and Python's libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. I wanted to share these exercises to contribute to those who wish to progress in Python.

I hope these notes will help you to improve your analysing and visualisation skills and be useful for other learners like you. I look forward to your comments and feedback!
